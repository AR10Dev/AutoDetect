- **Image Object Detection**: Upload and analyze images to detect objects.
- **Video Object Detection**: Process video files to identify objects in each frame.
- **Webcam Real-time Detection**: Utilize your webcam for live object detection.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI built with [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).
- **Detailed Detection Information**: View confidence scores and bounding box coordinates for detected objects.
